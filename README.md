## 📌 TASK 1: Number Guessing Game 🎯

### Description:
A simple number guessing game where the program randomly selects a number, and the user tries to guess it. After each guess, feedback is given to indicate whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

### Features:
- Random number generation
- User input for guesses
- Feedback on each guess
- Loop continues until correct guess

## 📌 TASK 2: Simple Calculator ➕➖✖️➗

### Description:
A basic calculator that performs arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### Features:
- Input: Two numbers and the desired operation
- Operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- Displays the result based on selected operation
